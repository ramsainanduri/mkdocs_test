# Pipeline Components

To automate the documentation for a pipeline, the following pipeline components are included, #Can have specific keys based on the pipeline, free free to modify, add, delete keys in this section depending on the pipeline


## Data Retrieval

This step involves retrieving data related to the pipeline, such as the code, input data, and output data.

## Parsing

This step involves parsing the code and the input and output data to extract relevant information, such as the pipeline components, their parameters, and their inputs and outputs.

## Template Generation

This step involves generating a template for the documentation based on the parsed information. The template should include sections for the pipeline components, their descriptions, their parameters, and their inputs and outputs.

## Documentation Generation

This step involves generating the actual documentation by populating the template with the parsed information. The documentation should be generated in a format that is easily readable and accessible, such as HTML or PDF.

## Version Control

This step involves using version control software, such as Git, to track changes to the documentation over time, and to maintain a history of the documentation.

## Workflow Management

This step involves using workflow management software, such as Snakemake or Nextflow, to automate the pipeline components and manage dependencies between the components.

## Maintenance And Support

This step involves maintaining and supporting the documentation over time, including regular updates and bug fixes.
