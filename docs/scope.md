# Scope

## Purpose

The program aims to simplify the process of creating and maintaining documentation for software projects using MkDocs and Read the Docs.

## Audience

The program is designed for developers, technical writers, and project managers who want to create high-quality documentation with minimal effort.

## Functionality

The program will automatically generate documentation for a software project using the MkDocs framework, which allows for the creation of user-friendly, responsive documentation sites. The documentation site will be hosted on Read the Docs, which provides a robust platform for hosting and managing documentation.

## Features

The program will include the following features:
- Automated creation of documentation using MkDocs
- Integration with Read the Docs for hosting and management of documentation sites
- Customizable templates for documentation sites
- Support for multiple documentation versions and languages
- Integration with source control systems such as Git

## Technology Stack

The program will be developed using Python and will use the MkDocs and Read the Docs APIs to generate and host documentation sites.

## Limitations

The program may be limited by the capabilities of MkDocs and Read the Docs, and may not be suitable for projects with complex documentation requirements.

## Maintenance And Support

The program will be maintained and supported by the development team, who will provide regular updates and bug fixes. Documentation and user support will also be provided.

## Expected Outcomes

The program is expected to simplify the process of creating and maintaining documentation, reduce the amount of time and effort required to create documentation sites, and improve the overall quality of documentation for software projects.
